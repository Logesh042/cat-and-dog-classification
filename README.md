#training time reduction using cat and dog classification
Image resizing and cropping: Reduce the resolution of images to a smaller size. For instance, resizing to 128x128 pixels can greatly reduce the data processed per image while still retaining enough information to distinguish between cats and dogs.
Data Augmentation: Apply real-time augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or zooming to reduce the need for a large dataset. This reduces overfitting and helps generalize the model without needing large training sets.
Batch normalization: By normalizing data before input into the model, the network converges faster, reducing the number of epochs needed.
Transfer Learning: Use pre-trained models such as VGG16, ResNet, or MobileNet, which already know low-level features like edges and textures. By fine-tuning the last few layers, you can drastically reduce the amount of time needed to train the model.
Model pruning: Remove unnecessary neurons and layers from a model, reducing the overall computational complexity without significantly sacrificing accuracy.
Smaller models: Instead of using a deep model like ResNet50 or VGG19, opt for lightweight models like MobileNet, EfficientNet, or SqueezeNet which require fewer computations, leading to faster training times.
